## Project context

The context of this project was the use of mathematical formulas and functions in order to study and learn about:

* linear algebra
* probability and statistics
* derivative calculation
* central limit theorem
* sorting algorithm

The exercises started with simple calculations using vectors.

We then moved on to understanding vectors, how they work, their characteristics and what defines them.

We've learned about the identity matrix and what it is used for, as well as the inverse of a matrix and its properties.

For probabilities and statistics we've focused on basic probabilities and the **theorem of central limit**.

We've also learned the use of **boxplot** and the information they provide when used correctly with variables. 

And the exercises finished with calculation of derivatives. 

## Importance of mathematics for Data Science and Machine Learning


Mathematics represent the basis of all scientific disciplines. Almost all Data Science and machine learning concepts are based on mathematics.

It is very important to know how an algorithm works in the most basic sense in order to be able to implement, and modify it.

Let's take statistics for example, it is important to know some of the basic notions such as descriptive statistics, variance, correlations and so on.

**Central Limit Theorem**

The central limit theorem (CLT) is one of the most important theorems in statistics. It states that the distribution of the sample mean of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normal, regardless of the distribution of the underlying random variables.

The CLT is used in a wide variety of applications, including:

-   **Confidence intervals:** The CLT can be used to construct confidence intervals for the population mean.
-   **Hypothesis testing:** The CLT can be used to conduct hypothesis tests about the population mean.
-   **Power analysis:** The CLT can be used to determine the sample size needed to achieve a desired power for a hypothesis test.
-   **Sampling distributions:** The CLT can be used to derive the sampling distributions of many common statistics, such as the t-statistic and the chi-squared statistic.

**Boxplot**

A boxplot is a graphical method for displaying the distribution of a set of data. It shows the five-number summary of the data: the minimum, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum.

Boxplots are useful for identifying outliers and comparing the distributions of different groups of data. For example, a boxplot could be used to compare the heights of men and women, or the test scores of students in two different classes.

## Conclusion

Mathematics is essential for Data Science and machine learning. A strong foundation in mathematics will allow you to better understand and implement machine learning algorithms, and to interpret the results of your analyses.
